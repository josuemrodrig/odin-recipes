    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <div class="text">
    <ul>
        <li>4 Guajillo chilies, open, clean and seedless</li>
        <li>4 Ancho chili peppers, opened, clean and without seeds</li>
        <li>2 Garlic cloves minced</li>
        <li>¼ Teaspoon dried Mexican oregano</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>12 Corn tortillas</li>
        <li>2 Cups of shredded pork or chicken (optional)</li>
        <li>1 ½ Cups fresh cheese</li>
        <li>½ Cup finely chopped white onion</li>
        <li>⅓ Cup vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Preparation</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Let's start with the sauce: Lightly toast the chiles on a hot griddle, pressing them with the help of a spatula, but making sure not to burn them. (This step takes only a few seconds on each side)</li>
        <li>Once the chiles are roasted, place them in a saucepan with water and cook them over low heat for 15 minutes, or until they are soft</li>
        <li>Remove the pot from the heat and let the chiles cool for 10 to 15 minutes. (Remember that these should be smooth and soft)</li>
        <li>After the chiles have cooled, drain them and place them in the blender along with the garlic cloves; add ½ cup of clean water and blend until you get a smooth sauce. (If the sauce is too thick or the chiles were not ground well, it is necessary to pass it through a fine sieve)</li>
        <li>Season with oregano, salt and pepper. Preheat oven to 350oF (180oC) to keep enchiladas warm while you finish assembling them</li>
        <li>In a large skillet add the 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil and heat over medium heat. (Add the oil little by little as needed while you fry the tortillas, since if you add it all at once the tortillas will absorb it and break)
        </li>
        <li>Dip the tortillas one at a time in the sauce until both sides are well moistened. Then place the tortilla in the pan with the hot oil and fry on both sides. (This only takes a few seconds)</li>
        <li>Place the enchilada on a plate. Add more oil to the pan as needed and continue with the process of frying the tortillas: first pass them through the sauce and then through the oil</li>
        <li>Place the plate where you are putting the enchiladas inside the preheated oven to keep them warm while you finish frying the rest of the tortillas</li>
        <li>To serve the enchiladas, first place the filling of your choice in the center of the tortilla and then fold or roll it</li>
    </ol>
